# Scadla: scala library for constructive solid geometry

Scadla is a small library to create 3D models.
Those model can then, for instance, be 3D printed.
Scadla is very much influence by OpenSCAD and has the same goal of being a _programmer's CAD_ tool.
The name scadla is a portmanteau of scad and scala.


Why scadla? OpenSCAD is doing a pretty good job and is becoming a de facto standard in the maker community.

That is true. OpenSCAD is usually doing a pretty fine job and we currently use it in the back end.
However, there is a few things that, IMO, OpenSCAD did not get right or missing features that a good general purpose programming language, like scala, gives you for free.
So instead of developing a new language, scadla simply embed CSG into an existing language.
The main points on which we try to improve are:

* modularity/reusability, package/namespace, toolchain support, etc. IMO OpenSCAD does not scale very well to projects across multiple files. The `use` vs `include` is very coarse grained. The absence of namespace gives rise to very long variable names in order to avoid clash. Fortunately, you get those things for free in scala. Also the toolchain is more mature. For instance, one can use maven to share libraries of objects and then just specify in project configuration which library to use and sbt will download them automatically, add them to the classpath, ...

* _first class objects_ An OpenSCAD program roughly build a tree with primitive objects as leaves and CSG operations as internal nodes. However, that tree is built implicitly and one cannot access it directly. In scadla, that tree is just an algebraic datatype. This means that you can reference it, e.g., `val u = Union(Cube(...), Sphere(...))` and also inspect/modify it using pattern matching, e.g., `u match { case Union(...) => ... }`

* variables evaluation and other small quirks

* all the angles are in _radians_, not in degrees. Because ... math! If you still prefer degrees you can write `math.toRadians(Î±)`.


## Examples

For examples, please look in the `src/main/scala/dzuffere/scadla/examples` folder.

TODO more complete description ... the different syntaxes


## Dependencies

For the moment, scadla uses
 * required: [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) for the CSG operations
 * optional: [Meshlab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/) to display the models


## Compiling

You can build scadla using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).
To install sbt follow the instructions at [http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/tutorial/Setup.html](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/tutorial/Setup.html).

Then, in a console, execute:
```
$ sbt
> compile
```

## Using it

TODO ...


## TODO

Features that may (or may not) be implemented, depending on time and motivation:

* making object smaller: instead of adding some tolerance to all dimension, design your object at the right size, the make them a bit smaller so they fit together. The goal is to move the face parallel to their normal by some amount while keeping the mesh well-formed.
* geometry shader (similar to computer graphics) to modify the surface of objects, e.g., adding a pattern to a flat surface.
* holes and parts like in SolidPython
* directly do the CSG operation without requiring OpenSCAD
* 2D primitives, extrusions, and projections
* ...

Also, pull requests are welcome.
