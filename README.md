# Scadla: scala library for constructive solid geometry

Scadla is a small library to create 3D models.
Those model can then, for instance, be 3D printed.
Scadla is very much influence by OpenSCAD and has the same goal of being a _programmer's CAD_ tool.
The name scadla is a portmanteau of scad and scala.


Why scadla? OpenSCAD is doing a pretty good job and is becoming a de facto standard in the maker community.

That is true. OpenSCAD is usually doing a pretty fine job and we currently use it in the back end.
However, there is a few things that, IMO, OpenSCAD did not get right or missing features that a good general purpose programming language, like scala, gives you for free.
So instead of developing a new language, scadla simply embed CSG into an existing language.
The main points on which we try to improve are:

* modularity/reusability, package/namespace, toolchain support, etc. IMO OpenSCAD does not scale very well to projects across multiple files. The `use` vs `include` is very coarse grained. The absence of namespace gives rise to very long variable names in order to avoid clash. Fortunately, you get those things for free in scala. Also the toolchain is more mature. For instance, one can use maven to share libraries of objects and then just specify in project configuration which library to use and sbt will download them automatically, add them to the classpath, ...

* _first class objects_ An OpenSCAD program roughly build a tree with primitive objects as leaves and CSG operations as internal nodes. However, that tree is built implicitly and one cannot access it directly. In scadla, that tree is just an algebraic datatype. This means that you can reference it, e.g., `val u = Union(Cube(...), Sphere(...))` and also inspect/modify it using pattern matching, e.g., `u match { case Union(...) => ... }`

* variables evaluation and other small quirks

* all the angles are in _radians_, not in degrees. Because ... math! If you still prefer degrees you can write `math.toRadians(Î±)`.


## Dependencies

For the moment, scadla uses
* required: [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) for the CSG operations
* optional: [Meshlab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/) to display the models


## Examples

For examples, please look in the [example](src/main/scala/dzuffere/scadla/examples) folder.

For a complete example, you can head to [MecanumWheel.scala](src/main/scala/dzufferey/scadla/examples/MecanumWheel.scala) for a parametric design of an omnidirectional wheel.

The primitives and CSG operations are defined in [Solid.scala](src/main/scala/dzuffere/scadla/Solid.scala).
This gives you a basic verbose syntax.
For instance, a cube written `cube([1,2,1])` in OpenSCAD is written `Cube(1,2,1)` in scadla.

Let us consider the following example:
```scala
Intersection(
  Union(
    Cube(1,1,1),
    Translate( -0.5, -0.5, 0, Cube(1,1,1))
  ),
  Sphere(1.5)
)
```
In the most verbose form, it corresponds to the full CSG tree.
However, we can make it prettier.
First, we can store `Solid`s in variables and reuse them:
```scala
val c = Cube(1,1,1)
val s = Sphere(1.5)
val u = Union(c, Translate( -0.5, -0.5, 0, c))
Intersection(u, s)
```
Next, we can replace the operation with a less verbose syntax using `import InlineOps._`
```scala
val c = Cube(1,1,1)
val s = Sphere(1.5)
(c + c.move( -0.5, -0.5, 0)) * s
```

Once, we have the descprition of the object we want to make, we need to evaluate the CSG tree to get a 3D model.
We currently use OpenSCAD for that.
See [OpenSCAD.scala](src/main/scala/dzufferey/scadla/backends/OpenSCAD.scala) for the details.

Assuming that we the object we are interested in is stored in the `obj` variable.
We can do a few things:
* evaluate the tree and save the result in a .stl file with `OpenSCAD.toSTL(obj, file_name)`
* view the result `OpenSCAD.view(obj)` (this requires meshlab)
* evaluate the tree and get back a Polyhedron with `OpenSCAD.getResult(obj)`

By default, scadla will run openscad with `$fa=4; $fs=0.5;`, so complex designs can take a while to render.
You can change that by giving the appropriate arguments to the different methods (see `OpenSCAD.scala` for the details)


## Compiling and Using it

You can build scadla using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).
To install sbt follow the instructions at [http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/tutorial/Setup.html](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/tutorial/Setup.html).

Then, in a console, execute:
```
$ sbt
> compile
```

`sbt run` will executes the omniwheel example.

Currently scadla is not yet published in an online maven repository.
If you want to use it in another project, run `sbt publishLocal` to make it available to other projects on the same machine. You can include it in your projects by adding `libraryDependencies += "io.github.dzufferey" %% "scadla" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"` in your `build.sbt`.


## TODO

Features that may (or may not) be implemented, depending on time and motivation:

* making object smaller: instead of adding some tolerance to all dimension, design your object at the right size, the make them a bit smaller so they fit together. The goal is to move the face parallel to their normal by some amount while keeping the mesh well-formed.
* geometry shader (similar to computer graphics) to modify the surface of objects, e.g., adding a pattern to a flat surface.
* holes and parts like in SolidPython
* directly do the CSG operation without requiring OpenSCAD
* 2D primitives, extrusions, and projections
* ...

Also, pull requests are welcome.
